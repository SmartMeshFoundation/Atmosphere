/*
 Quick overview
 --------------

 Goals:
 - Reliable failure recovery.

 Approach:
 - Use a write-ahead-log for state changes. Under a node restart the
 latest state snapshot can be recovered and the pending state changes
 reaplied.

 Requirements:
 - The function call `state_transition(curr_state, state_change)` must be
 deterministic, the recovery depends on the re-execution of the state changes
 from the WAL and must produce the same result.
 - StateChange must be idenpotent because the partner node might be recovering
 from a failure and a Event might be produced more than once.

 Requirements that are enforced:
 - A state_transition function must not produce a result that must be further
 processed, i.e. the state change must be self contained and the result state
 tree must be serializable to produce a snapshot. To enforce this inputs and
 outputs are separated under different class hierarquies (StateChange and Event).

/*
State is  An isolated state, modified by StateChange messages.

Notes:
- Don't duplicate the same state data in two different States, instead use
identifiers.
- State objects may be nested.
- State classes don't have logic by design.
- Each iteration must operate on fresh copy of the state, treating the old
      objects as immutable.
- This class is used as a marker for states.

Event produced by the execution of a state change.

    Nomenclature convention:
    - 'Send' prefix for protocol messages.
    - 'ContractSend' prefix for smart contract function calls.
    - 'Event' for node events.

    Notes:
    - This class is used as a marker for events.
    - These objects don't have logic by design.
    - Separate events are preferred because there is a decoupling of what the
      upper layer will use the events for.

/*
StateChange Declare the transition to be applied in a state object.

    StateChanges are incoming events that change this node state (eg. a
    blockchain event, a new packet, an error). It is not used for the node to
    communicate with the outer world.

    Nomenclature convention:
    - 'Receive' prefix for protocol messages.
    - 'ContractReceive' prefix for smart contract logs.
    - 'Action' prefix for other interactions.

    Notes:
    - These objects don't have logic by design.
    - This class is used as a marker for state changes.
