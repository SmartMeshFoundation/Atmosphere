/*
EventTransferSentSuccess emitted by the initiator when a transfer is considered sucessful.

    A transfer is considered sucessful when the initiator's payee hop sends the
    reveal secret message, assuming that each hop in the mediator chain has
    also learned the secret and unlock/withdraw its token.

    This definition of sucessful is used to avoid the following corner case:

    - The reveal secret message is sent, since the network is unreliable and we
      assume byzantine behavior the message is considered delivered without an
      acknowledgement.
    - The transfer is considered sucessful because of the above.
    - The reveal secret message was not delivered because of actual network
      problems.
    - The lock expires and an EventUnlockFailed follows, contradicting the
      EventTransferSentSuccess.

        Mediators cannot use this event, since an unlock may be locally
        sucessful but there is no knowledge about the global transfer.

EventTransferReceivedSuccess emitted when a payee has received a payment.

        A payee knows if a lock withdraw has failed, but this is not sufficient

        try again at a different time and/or with different routes, for this reason
        there is no correspoding `EventTransferReceivedFailed`.
