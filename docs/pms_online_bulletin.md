## How to use itï¼Ÿ

If you want to use PMS on the main network or test network, you can modify it based on the above information.

1. The contract address of the node, ensuring that the contract address of the node is the same as the contract address of the PMS
2. The agent charges the token to ensure that the node has a proxy toll at the proxy charging node 
3. Modify the corresponding URL parameter when calling the interface.For example: `GET http://transport01.smartmesh.cn:7004/tx/<delegater_address>/<channel_address>`
